* My jQuery is link is not working. It seems that the link in the index is not communicating with the actual jQuery file. I started from scratch and redownloaded it and is still giving me the "file not found" error and is saying the jQuery files are not defined. I followed along with lectures and downloaded it straight from the jQuery site so I'm not sure where I went wrong. 
* I tried by best to follow along with examples even though I have not been able to test it looks as close as I could get to your examples.
